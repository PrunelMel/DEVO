<!-- As three computer science students —Friedrich, Armand, and Prunel—we faced a familiar frustration: countless hours wasted sifting through unreliable online programming resources. Rather than accepting this reality, we decided to take matters into our own hands.

Driven by our need for a more trustworthy and streamlined learning experience, we created a platform that connects students with high-quality educational content while keeping them at the forefront of computer science innovation.

Our vision is simple but powerful: eliminate knowledge barriers so that the focus can shift to where it belongs—building the future. -->
